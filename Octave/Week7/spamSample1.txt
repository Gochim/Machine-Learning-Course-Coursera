Your timing is excellent. I'm just about to offer up the extra shirts from the kickstarter for sale at a discount. If you pick from sizes and colors I have on hand, they're $10 each. If you want a size or color that I don't have on hand, then these designs will appear in our store in October, but the prices will be higher because they'll be print on demand. 

If you see any shirts you want from the list below, I need you to email Schlockmercenary@gmail.com with the subject line: Overstocked Shirts. The body of the email should contain which shirt design, size, color, & quantity you want.  Once I get your list, I'll send you an invoice via Paypal to pay for the shirts. This is first come, first served, so responding promptly is advised. I'll be posting this same list for the rest of the backers on Monday.
